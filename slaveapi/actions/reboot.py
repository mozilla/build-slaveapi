    peacefully to mercilessly. Details of what was attempted and the result
    are reported into the slave's problem tracking bug at the end. Reboots
    are attempted through the following means (from most peaceful to least
    merciful):

    * SSH: Logs into the machine via SSH and reboots it with an \
        appropriate command.

    * IPMI: Uses the slave's IPMI interface to initiate a hard \
        reboot. If the slave has no IPMI interface, this is skipped.

    * PDU: Powercycles the slave by turning off the power, and then \
        turning it back on.

    * Bugzilla: Requests that IT reboot the slave by updating or creating \
        the appropriate bugs.
